Cloning effect done in Adobe After Effects CS5, story sequence done in Adobe Premiere CS5. When filming this by myself, I decided to not use a green screen and instead roto out the clones from each clip (I didn't have a stand at the time and didn't have anyone to hold the screen). Not the greatest roto job, but it's a done roto job and the best roto job is a done one ;-)
